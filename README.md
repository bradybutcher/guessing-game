# guessing-game
A game that generates a random number between 1 and 100, allowing the player to guess that number by evaluating their original guess to let them know whether your guess was too high or too low. When the correct number is guessed, the player recieves a message saying, "YOU WIN!" and letting them know their total number of guesses and how many of those guesses were high or low.
